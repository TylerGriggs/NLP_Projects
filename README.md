# NLP Scripts

## Overview
Natural Language Processing algorithms for training, testing and saving models.

Many of the Python scripts involve command line arguments to read text files or retrieve text information from API requests. Supervised training samples are provided in some cases, and the ability to create new supervised data from Twitter and YouTube is provided in the /sentiment directory, provided by [twitter-scraper](https://github.com/bisguzar/twitter-scraper) and [youtube-data-api](https://github.com/mabrownnyu/youtube-data-api) packages.
Projects inspired by Introduction to Natural Language Processing coursework.
